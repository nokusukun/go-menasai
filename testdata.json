I've been petty since elementary school.\n\nI have so much to share but since I was recently telling someone about this, I thought I'd do this one first. A while back, I took my nephews to McDonald's to go play and eat. As y'all probably know, there's two parts to most McDonald's, the main dining area and the play area, divided by a wall, sometimes even a door. It was at noon so it was dead. We sat at the far end of the play area. There's at least 15 other tables in the play area and 15 more in the dining area. Other than us, there was one group of old people and this lady in the entire place. The lady decides to sit at the table next to us *AND* in the seat closest to our table! Every time the kids start talking or laughing, not even loudly I might add, she would roll her eyes and stare at us with her eyes wide open as if to say \"STFU\". I didn't look at her because I wanted to deny her the attention she craved. They were toddlers so of course they would be talkative. \"Hey Anon!\" \"Yes?\" \"I like Paw Patrol!\" That type of stuff. What really did it for me was when she started shushing them with the loudest shushes she could muster. I moved to the opposite side of the room and she still kept doing it from across the room. She got up and started talking to the employees at the counter, probably complaining about me since I wouldn't give into her attention seeking. Funny thing was that in all her stares and shushing, she only ate about a quarter of her burger and her fries and left it behind. Since she was at the front counter, she couldn't see the play area. I threw her meal away. I really wish she had left her phone or something so I could've thrown those in the trash as well.\n\nMoral of the story, don't go out of your way to play the victim.\n\nEdit: wording\n\nEdit 2: fixed some sentences",

What really did it for me was when she started shushing them with the loudest shushes she could muster. I moved to the opposite side of the room and she still kept doing it from across the room. She got up and started talking to the employees at the counter, probably complaining about me since I wouldn&amp;#39;t give into her attention seeking. Funny thing was that in all her stares and shushing, she only ate about a quarter of her burger and her fries and left it behind. Since she was at the front counter, she couldn&amp;#39;t see the play area. I threw her meal away. I really wish she had left her phone or something so I could&amp;#39;ve thrown those in the trash as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story, don&amp;#39;t go out of your way to play the victim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: wording&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: fixed some sentences&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I am a mobile user blah blah blah...\n\nI was hired as an office manager at a company I had previously worked for and this pissed the other employee in the office off. She thought she should have been promoted to office manager instead. I started having some health issues and had to leave occasionally to go to the dr. One day I had a dr. appt. and I found out that I had endometrial cancer. This coworker texted me and asked if I was coming in and I told her that I had just found out that I had endometrial cancer and I was very emotional so I was going to take the rest of the day to process things and inform my family. She got pissed because I wasn\u2019t coming in and started an argument via text. We made up shortly after and it was fine. \n\nHR and corporate made a visit to our store about 2 weeks later and they called my co worker in to the conference room to talk. She came back and I asked her what it was about and she said she finally got the raise she has been asking for. We made up a week or so before so as far as I knew things were fine. I congratulated my coworker and told her she deserved the raise! The next day I was called into the conference room and told that I was accused of sexual harassment. I was investigated and it was humiliating. The truth was me and this girl talked about our sex lives, we talked about our bodies and she had even sent me a photo of her boobs which I still had. \n\nAfter the investigation was complete I got to keep my job and nothing happened to my coworker. The general manager accused me of lying during my interview so right then I decided I was done with these people. My coworker was terrified when she heard I was coming back and I was still her boss. I pretended to be nice to her until I found another job. The day I got the job I went in and said I quit and told my boss that he was garbage. I went and got my stuff and walked out after that. \n\nAbout 6 months later I had a friend of mine go in and test drive a car. She went along on the test drive. He made sure to take his time and test drive as long as he could. The next day he called corporate and told them he went on a test drive with her and she was asking for his number, making him very uncomfortable and even had him pull over so that she could try to kiss him. He also said she tried to force his hands down her pants and showed him her tattoos down by her vagina. I knew about these tattoos so he was able to describe them perfectly. \n\nThis girl was fired and I didn\u2019t feel bad about it at all. I was a single parent and was doing everything on my own at the time and she knew that and still tried to take my job from me. Also she still wasn\u2019t promoted to office manager even after I quit!",

I congratulated my coworker and told her she deserved the raise! The next day I was called into the conference room and told that I was accused of sexual harassment. I was investigated and it was humiliating. The truth was me and this girl talked about our sex lives, we talked about our bodies and she had even sent me a photo of her boobs which I still had. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the investigation was complete I got to keep my job and nothing happened to my coworker. The general manager accused me of lying during my interview so right then I decided I was done with these people. My coworker was terrified when she heard I was coming back and I was still her boss. I pretended to be nice to her until I found another job. The day I got the job I went in and said I quit and told my boss that he was garbage. I went and got my stuff and walked out after that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 6 months later I had a friend of mine go in and test drive a car. She went along on the test drive. He made sure to take his time and test drive as long as he could. The next day he called corporate and told them he went on a test drive with her and she was asking for his number, making him very uncomfortable and even had him pull over so that she could try to kiss him. He also said she tried to force his hands down her pants and showed him her tattoos down by her vagina. I knew about these tattoos so he was able to describe them perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This girl was fired and I didn\u2019t feel bad about it at all. I was a single parent and was doing everything on my own at the time and she knew that and still tried to take my job from me. Also she still wasn\u2019t promoted to office manager even after I quit!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Furthermore, I'm on mobile, so apologies in advance for any formatting errors/rules broken (God forbid).\n\nNow, if you haven't read my previous post on r/worksucks, I've been working as a science technician in a local comprehensive school for the past four years. (Essentially the U.K's answer to non-grammar high school.)  And I've been trying to leave over the past year for various reasons. This includes lazy teachers, endless politics and a shocking salary, but the reason that's cemented by desire to leave... is the BLOODY KIDS.\n\nI'll put my hands up right now and state that most of these kids are fine. But whilst they probably aren't on London comprehensive levels of bad, the poorly behaved students here are horrendous. Name calling, stealing our equipment, incessant harrassment, invasion of privacy/personal space and even assault. These are just some of the things I've had to endure from the worst of the lot. \n\nI have loads more stories from my time working here, so let me know which subreddit to post to if you want to hear more.\n\nI am unfortunately paid to tolerate these morons. However, there's one instance where I was able to exact some petty revenge.\n\nOnce, I entered a lab to deliver some books. (something we aren't supposed to do, but that's another story.) No less than three seconds after I did, two girls in the back row of the room started yelling inappropriate comments across the classroom such as: \"I love you!\" and \"Have my babies!\" (For the record, I'm an average looking 25 year old male - 23 at the time. But they couldn't have been older than 14. Why did they think this was okay?)\n\nMy immediate thoughts were: \"Yeah, I'm not dealing with this.\" So I left the room immediately. Just as I was making a mental note to avoid this room for the remainder of the period, the Vice Principal just happened to walk by that room. And as good luck would have it, this conversation ensued.\n\nVP: Morning GBP, how are you doing?\n\nMe: *Seeing opportunity for petty revenge* \n\nFunny you should ask. Can I borrow you for a minute?\n\nVP: Yes, of course.\n\nI took him to the door of the classroom, put my hand on the door, and said:\n\n\"Observe.\"\n\nThe SECOND I opened the door, those two girls started up with the stomach churning comments again. And VP heard everything. He dragged them out of the classroom and ripped into them for their inappropriate behaviour whilst I hid around the corner. I unfortunately don't remember everything that was said, but the students tried to protest how it wasn't inappropriate at all. Goes to show how stupid some of them are.\n\nIt didn't help much with the way I was treated. But revenge is underrated - a petty victory over these idiots felt great.\n\n(I'm currently waiting to hear back from a recent job interview, so hopefully I won't have to bear this for that much longer. Fingers crossed!)",

Just as I was making a mental note to avoid this room for the remainder of the period, the Vice Principal just happened to walk by that room. And as good luck would have it, this conversation ensued.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VP: Morning GBP, how are you doing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;Seeing opportunity for petty revenge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Funny you should ask. Can I borrow you for a minute?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VP: Yes, of course.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took him to the door of the classroom, put my hand on the door, and said:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Observe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The SECOND I opened the door, those two girls started up with the stomach churning comments again. And VP heard everything. He dragged them out of the classroom and ripped into them for their inappropriate behaviour whilst I hid around the corner. I unfortunately don&amp;#39;t remember everything that was said, but the students tried to protest how it wasn&amp;#39;t inappropriate at all. Goes to show how stupid some of them are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t help much with the way I was treated. But revenge is underrated - a petty victory over these idiots felt great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;m currently waiting to hear back from a recent job interview, so hopefully I won&amp;#39;t have to bear this for that much longer. Fingers crossed!)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I was in this school for years and had known a lot of the teachers from the time i was a kid (some of them were even in high school when i went there for elementary). I left for a few years and came back for high school. Now i wasn't a good student by any means. Me and my friends always talked (quietly thank god) among ourselves during classes (still taking notes, participating as needed, and listening when there was a lecture). I have PLENTY of stories from three teachers (including getting marked off for correct answers on a test, and yelled at for pointing it out since it was peer graded and \"they wouldn't mark it wrong if it wasn't\") and this one is one of the biggest. So this teacher and i typically got along very well, i knew the material and always aced my tests, we joked around, and even shared the same taste in books (even if she didn't read much anymore due to juggling so many roles.)\n\nImagine my surprise when an assembly is called to decide what to do with a trouble maker an I'M the one called to the front. The teacher begins BLASTING me in front of the school and headmaster (who I'm very close to and consider a second father). I'm absolutely dying inside from embarrassment because shes pulling up my \"misbehavior\" (talking with my friends quietly because we had free time in class after and assignment while completely ignoring the girls who screeched like banshees when ever they talked. This actually was a major frustration for me and the other high school guys but that a story for another day) and my \"terrible performance in class\". The head master asked for proof and they brought out my grades sheet for homework (again, i wast the best student and with the way our grades were weighted i could legit never turn in a homework assignment or participate in class but still pass). The headmaster looked at the sheet and decided that my grades (just my homework) was low enough to expel me. The other students got upset by this point and said to show him my tests sheet as well. I legitimately only got less than a 90% on a test or quiz ONCE and with my participation i was a A-B student depending on how many tests i got (and with finals being the most heavily weighted thing you could pass the final and pass the class while failing almost anything else). The principal insisted that it was just clerical error so the matter got dropped for the time, but revenge was brewing already.\n\nThe other high school guys and i asked the headmaster for a \"Kings leadership class\" (code for we wanted him to come in for a class just for the male students, the female students had a queens leadership class with the headmasters wife). The headmaster came in without announcing anything to the staff and passed by the classrooms. Where we had the principal for English and science (double period with her in the morning). Where the guy were talking quietly and the girls were borderline screaming at times. Where the guys were being yelled at by the principal. For being too loud. The headmaster lost it and put her as well as several other staff he noticed who had the same double standards (the girls being loud but nothing said to but the guys talking quietly and being yelled at for being too loud) as he had apparently noticed it in other classes and his daughter doing it was the final straw. There were a handful of teachers spared from the rant that ended with him making very thinly veiled threats to fire the teachers for not following the rules he set in place. All because we asked him to come in. Life is good.",

It wasn't really a big deal, but it was still annoying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI grew up watching Mr Bean and I recalled a skit he did once and decided to recreate that as a form of revenge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI prepare for the next day. I come into class and set my pencil neatly on my desk. I take my time with it as though placing this pencil perfectly is the most important thing in the world to me. I then give the guy a smile. He stands up and swats it off of my desk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI continue to smile at him. I don't flinch. I maintain eye contact as my hand reaches into my pocket, and I pull out another pencil. I place it neatly right where my first pencil had been previously. Due blinks and swats it off of my desk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, I don't stop calmly smiling. I pause and then reach into my pocket and pull out another pencil and place it on the desk. At this point, the kid snorts a chuckle. This little morning ritual was starting to get interesting. Other kids were watching now. He knocks that one off too. It goes flying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pause. Longer now. I wait to see the gears turning in his mind, \"does he have another?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI place another on the table and continue to smile. Dude laughs for real this time. This time he swats it off because he wants to see how far this goes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reach into my pocket and begin to frown. I look up at him as if to say \"I'm all out.\" His smile begins to fade. I reach into my other pocket and begin to grin once more. I place another pencil on the table again. Again I take the time to carefully line it up on the table.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDude laughs hard and swats it off again. The whole class is watching now with amusement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright. Time for the big guns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reach into my coat pocket and draw out a stack -- 30 pencils or so -- and just roll them onto the table into as neat a line as I can manage. The whole class erupts into laughter. After a bit, he seems to think 'alright, you've had your fun' and begins frantically swatting them all off of my desk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI look up at him. I am unpfased. Unblinking. Still smiling. I withdraw another pencil and place it neatly on my desk -- making sure to line it up as precisely as possible. Dude burst into laughter, holding onto the desk to keep from falling to his knees. \"Alright! You win.\" He says appreciatively.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe helped me clean them all up and we became friends for the rest of that course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is a link to the sketch which inspired this petty revenge:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://youtu.be/-VM0XCvKNP0?t=78](https://youtu.be/-VM0XCvKNP0?t=78)",

                "selftext": "For the past year, I've been taking an Electrical Construstion and Industrial trades course at my local high school. I'm enrolled in the \"1 Year\" Program, which essentially ropes together the Grade 11 and 12 (Junior and Senior) years into a single year. Besides myself, there's 4 others taking the \"1 Year\" program, and we're all early-to-late 20's and tend to take the classes seriously. The younger kids, who we're sadly forced to learn alongside though, don't.\n\nFrom the start of the year, us 1 Years have had problems with the younger students: tool stealing, lewd/rude stuff being written on our work booth walls, and other annoying and distracting acts. But there's one weasel of a child that we all hated from the get-go: we'll call him Stanley.\n\nStanley was a reactionary. He overreacted whenever someone did anything to him: crack a joke, insult, ask for advice, etc. He was also super forgetful, and always misplaced a lot of his tools. Eventually, the teacher got sick of loaning him replacement tools, so what did Stanley do? He stole from us, of course.\n\nThough, we could never truly prove it. All of our tools were supplied by the school: same name brand, brand new and without any noticable markings. Honestly, looking back, I should've done something to mark my tools, but I didn't expect some kid to go and pilfer them. But we always knew who took them when we lost a tool, because Stanley would be walking around the shop, looking for the tool he misplaced, only to \"find it\" while our backs were turned, and now that same tool was missing from one of our tool belts. We went to our teacher, who would simply and politely ask Stanley if he took our tools, but he would put on a show, get his parents involved, etc, so we got nowhere.\n\nThen 3 weeks ago, I had had it with this kid. I wanted to catch him in a lie, embarrass the little twerp, nothing big. And this was what I came up with:\n\nI wear prescription safety glasses, so they're only useful to me; to anyone else, they're blurry and useless. Knowing this, I set to work on catching Stanley in the act. During a break period, I snatched Stanley's safety glasses when he wasn't looking, left mine out in the open, and made sure that my glasses were the first that Stanley would see. I go on break, doing my best to navigate the school without my glasses, come back, and sure enough, they were gone, and Stanley was walking around with a pair on his head.\n\nGot you now, you little shit.\n\nBreak ended, and we set to work. From what I could see with my shitter vision, Stanley was a little confused as to why he couldn't clearly see through the new set of glasses he pillaged. After a few seconds, he made his way up to the teacher's office, and after placing his glasses back in plain sight of his work booth, I followed him. The following exchanges ensued:\n\n**Stanley**: Hey, Mr. Teacher, my glasses are a little weird, I can't see a thing through them. Can I have a new pair?\n\n**Teacher**: Let me see them for a second.\n\n*Stanley hands the glasses to him as I lean against the doorway*\n\n**Teacher**: That IS weird, huh?\n\n**Me, holding back a shit-eating grin**: Let me take a look.\n\nI \"examine\" my glasses.\n\n**Me**: I can see perfectly fine through them! And I think I know why: these are my **PRESCRIPTION** safety glasses.\n\n*Stanley gets a look of \"Oh shit, I'm caught\" on his face*\n\n**Stanley**: I-I-I didn't purposely take them! They were in my booth! \n\n**Me**: Really? Cuz I can see a pair of safety glasses in your booth right now...\n\nStanley peered around me and saw the pair of safety glasses sitting perfectly in sight, in his booth. He gave an awkward, \"Oh, there they are....\" and walked back to retrieve them. \n\nMoral of the story: don't have sticky fingers, cuz you'll eventually just pick up trouble.",

                "selftext": "About 5 years ago, I moved to a new city across the country for school. The apartment manager was an older man in his 60's and his wife worked as manager of the office. Both absolutely hated young people, and everyone I talked to in the complex my age had had stories about the managers being unreasonably hostile about nothing. \n\nThe older guy particularly didn't like me, and I felt like he was constantly and actively looking for ways to be a dick. Every time I saw him taking garbage out or walking around the complex I said hi, and I tried to be friendly. The dude was just an asshole to me, but I didn't cause problems so he mostly just scowled at me or said snide remarks in passing.\n\nIn our complex, each resident was assigned their own parking spot number. There was a provision in the lease that all cars must be registered with the office, but I figured since it was *MY* spot, that only *I* could park in, it wouldn't be a huge deal to park my rental in my spot. I got home from school the first night with a rental at around 10:00 p.m. and the next morning, when I went to class at 7:30 a.m., I had a notice on my rental car that I needed to move the car or it would be towed. Someone had also spit on the driver's side window.\n\nI went to the office and talked to the wife, and she told me to read the lease. She lost her shit when I even mentioned that someone had spit on the car saying that it was probably a tenant that didn't like me (although it had never happened before I got this notice). She told me explicitly taht this was \"My first notice,\" which to me implied they would be actively looking for a reason for a second notice (i.e. the tow company is called).\n\nSince I kept the same rental car, the managers couldn't do anything at all after I registered my car. When the repairs were done, I just started parking my old car, which was already registered. However, my car needed a couple more repairs, and I didn't want to pay for a rental, so I got rides from my girlfriend (now wife). We decided to stay at my place one night, and so I parked in my spot with her car. I literally walked to the office at 9:30 p.m., but of course it was closed. I physically couldn't register my car that night. \n\nAs you can imagine, not 30 minutes later, my girlfriend looks outside and sees our manager looking into her car windows, and tells me that she's freaked out. I see what's going on, and watch him from my apartment. I see him make a call, and then place a piece of paper on the car as tow instructions. I knew we'd have a little bit of time for the tow to show up, so I watched for a couple of minutes to see what he did. As soon as I saw him walk a ways away from the car, I ran to the car, moved it, and parked it on the street outside the complex. I ripped the piece of paper off and crumpled it up, but the tow company had no right to tow a car off the street without city permission either way. \n\nI walked back to my apartment, and the manager got in my way. He started yelling that I couldn't move a car once it had been marked for tow, and I told him I didn't realize there was a tow truck on the way. I told him my girlfriend was really uncomfortable with the \"creepy old man\" who was looking into her car windows, and so she simply asked me to move it to the street. He was furious, and kept saying the tow was on its way. I handed him the crumpled tow instructions, and said that the situation sounded like the apartment manager's problem.\n\nWhen the tow came, we watched as the manager yelled at the tow operator, while the operator gave him a bill. He walked the tow truck operator to the car, but there was nothing anyone could do at that point. I moved in with my girlfriend shortly after.\n\nTL;dr - Apartment manager tried to tow my car, parked in my designated space out of spite. Gets the tow bill, and an empty apartment to fill.",

The dude was just an asshole to me, but I didn&amp;#39;t cause problems so he mostly just scowled at me or said snide remarks in passing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our complex, each resident was assigned their own parking spot number. There was a provision in the lease that all cars must be registered with the office, but I figured since it was &lt;em&gt;MY&lt;/em&gt; spot, that only &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; could park in, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be a huge deal to park my rental in my spot. I got home from school the first night with a rental at around 10:00 p.m. and the next morning, when I went to class at 7:30 a.m., I had a notice on my rental car that I needed to move the car or it would be towed. Someone had also spit on the driver&amp;#39;s side window.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to the office and talked to the wife, and she told me to read the lease. She lost her shit when I even mentioned that someone had spit on the car saying that it was probably a tenant that didn&amp;#39;t like me (although it had never happened before I got this notice). She told me explicitly taht this was &amp;quot;My first notice,&amp;quot; which to me implied they would be actively looking for a reason for a second notice (i.e. the tow company is called).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I kept the same rental car, the managers couldn&amp;#39;t do anything at all after I registered my car. When the repairs were done, I just started parking my old car, which was already registered. However, my car needed a couple more repairs, and I didn&amp;#39;t want to pay for a rental, so I got rides from my girlfriend (now wife). We decided to stay at my place one night, and so I parked in my spot with her car. I literally walked to the office at 9:30 p.m., but of course it was closed. I physically couldn&amp;#39;t register my car that night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, not 30 minutes later, my girlfriend looks outside and sees our manager looking into her car windows, and tells me that she&amp;#39;s freaked out. I see what&amp;#39;s going on, and watch him from my apartment. I see him make a call, and then place a piece of paper on the car as tow instructions. I knew we&amp;#39;d have a little bit of time for the tow to show up, so I watched for a couple of minutes to see what he did. As soon as I saw him walk a ways away from the car, I ran to the car, moved it, and parked it on the street outside the complex. I ripped the piece of paper off and crumpled it up, but the tow company had no right to tow a car off the street without city permission either way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked back to my apartment, and the manager got in my way. He started yelling that I couldn&amp;#39;t move a car once it had been marked for tow, and I told him I didn&amp;#39;t realize there was a tow truck on the way. I told him my girlfriend was really uncomfortable with the &amp;quot;creepy old man&amp;quot; who was looking into her car windows, and so she simply asked me to move it to the street. He was furious, and kept saying the tow was on its way. I handed him the crumpled tow instructions, and said that the situation sounded like the apartment manager&amp;#39;s problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the tow came, we watched as the manager yelled at the tow operator, while the operator gave him a bill. He walked the tow truck operator to the car, but there was nothing anyone could do at that point. I moved in with my girlfriend shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;dr - Apartment manager tried to tow my car, parked in my designated space out of spite. Gets the tow bill, and an empty apartment to fill.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
